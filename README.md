# Packer in Docker

This Dockerfile is used to build a docker image containing the following applications:

* CentOS
* boto
* [packer](http://packer.io) - currently version 1.1.1
* latest AWS CLI
* Microsoft PowerShell v6.0.0-beta.9
* AWSPowerShell dotnetCore PowerShell module

## local build

You can clone this repository locally and build the docker image on your own machine. You just need a local docker client for your OS.

`docker build -t packer-on-centos .`

This will build a docker image called `packer-on-centos` from the `Dockerfile`.
